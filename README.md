# Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the success of organizations applying for funding from Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit foundation. By doing so, it aims to improve the efficiency of funding decisions, enhance decision-making processes, and streamline the application process, ultimately enabling Alphabet Soup to allocate resources more effectively and make a greater impact through its philanthropic efforts.

    Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
    
  * MODEL 1
    The first Model, had to layers
  
    

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
